    m_Localized: 'This antarctic flightless creature can morph itself into a block
      of ice and take care of your path to the designated place. Be sure, though
      it feels quite well in a cold space, its heart can break through the thickest
      ice.


      This zoonaut is perfect for building stairs and platforms. Just
      be careful not to slip down!'

    m_Localized: 'This small mammal is insensitive at the starlight and lives under
      ground, so it loves mining in everything it found. Use one of its molehills
      as a jump pad and fly to the stars! If you noticed some tunnels on Mars, that''s
      probably its job.


      It may help other members of a crew to defeat long
      distances and heights.'

    m_Localized: "This orange catnip enthusiast is a true master of climbing. It
      can perform wall jumps, allowing it to reach places inaccessible to other animals.
      Before inviting it to your team, check that there isn\u2019t a dog around.\n\nIt
      will climb effortlessly, especially in situations where there isn\u2019t a
      horizontal platform to assist."
